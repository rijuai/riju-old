    <h2>
        99% of Riju's features are available to all users for free and without
        limits.
    </h2>
    <p>
        We offer a paid plan for users who want to support Riju and get access
        to premium features. Currently the paid plan is not yet decided. But, it
        will add more feature than the free plan and the free plan will always
        be free. No cross-selling or anything.
